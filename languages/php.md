## Style Guide

The PHP language has a strong community, and we aim to ensure our code style
lines up with generally-agreed best practices. As such, any PHP work should
follow the community-driven style guide available at
http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/ and also the PSR-4 autoloading standards available at https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md
