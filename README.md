# Development Standards

This repository contains our team's documented coding standards for each
language we use, as well as general development principles, code review
guidelines and checklist, and an application development security overview.

We have decided to open these guides and standards up to the public because we
feel they have value outside of our team.  Please feel free to make use of the
content in anyway you like, guided by the license terms below.

## Development Guides

### [General Principles](principles.md)

We have a small set of general software design principles that should be
followed regardless of project or language.  This document also includes
specific guidelines for object oriented development.

### [Application Security](security.md)

It's vital that architects, developers and testers all have a solid
understanding of the types of vulnerabilities that are common in modern web
applications: how to identify them, and how to avoid them.

### [Code Reviews](code-reviews.md)

Peer code reviews are a vital part of our development process.  They not only
allow for early capture of potential issues, but also as a method of spreading
knowledge through the team.  This document contains the what, why and how of
requesting and performing code reviews.

## Language-Specific Coding Standards

* [ColdFusion](languages/coldfusion.md)
* [CSS](languages/css.md)
* [JavaScript](languages/javascript.md)
* [PHP](languages/php.md)
* [Ruby](languages/ruby.md)

## Contributing

Although this documentation is publicly accessible, it's still a set of living
documents based on the current understanding and thinking of the team here at
globaldev.  Feel free to submit issues and pull requests, but please don't be
upset if they get closed due to discussions we have internally (although we'll
always try and explain the decision we've made).
